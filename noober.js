// Parse the data given in the random ride Object, and present it in human-readable format, for example: Noober X Passenger: Kiley Thompson - (260) 908-6886. Pickup at 1301 N State Pkwy, Chicago, IL 60624. Drop-off at 2362 N Clybourn Ave, Chicago, IL 60657.

// Approach the problem like we did in class â€“ write the recipe (algorithm) using comments, then write the code according to the recipe.

// Create a well-named variable for each data point in the Object. For example, passengerFirstName. Then, use these variables to construct your string of output to be written to the JavaScript console.

// Use conditional logic â€“ if the rider has requested the luxury "Purple" level of service, i.e. purpleRequested, display "Noober Purple" as the level of service, e.g. Noober Purple Passenger: Freeman Waters...

// If the numberOfPassengers in a single ride request is greater than 3, we'll need to upgrade to a larger car. Display "Noober XL" as the level of service.

// A request for Noober Purple supercedes the Noober XL logic. In other words, if a Noober Purple has been requested, it doesn't matter how many passengers there are. Anything else is the normal level of service, "Noober X".
